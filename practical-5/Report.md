 **Debugging**
 
 Debugging is the process of finding errors that prevent a computer program from running how it's intended to. 
 In my eyes it is one of if not the most important principle of software engineering. While debugging 
 a programmer not only can make the core of the software run like it is intended to but also figure out edge 
 case scenarios and prevent them from breaking anything. The main tool we used to debug was *pytest*, which is 
 a framework that makes it easy to write small tests and prints out the results in a clear manner. It works 
 by asserting certain values which passes if the value or statement is true and fails if it is false. Debugging 
 was fairly simple to learn and understand, especially using *pytest* as most of it is pretty self explanatory.
 
**Version control**

 Version control is the management of changes made to documents, computer programs, large websites or other 
 collections of information. It is crucial in the software development process as it saves all previous versions 
 of the project in one place. The tool we used for version control was git. Using version control did take some 
 getting used to, especially while working with a team as I had to communicate before committing any changes I had 
 made. After getting used to how version control works it did turn out to be incredibly useful in more than a few
 situations. 
 
 **Team management**
 
 The most important part of working on practical 3 was team management as we had to coordinate work between 5 people.
 Managing our team consisted of quite a few parts. We split up work in a fair way so that no one person was working 
 harder than everybody else. Communicated about our progress on our tasks and about committing changes to the code and
 helped out anyone struggling on stuck on something. I found that team management was difficult for me, I did not take 
 initiative or give my input as much as I would've wanted to.
 
 **Documentation**
 
 Documentation is a part of every public software project big or small. The point of it is to briefly explain the usage
 of said project, as in what its uses might be, how certain functions can be called etc. Documentation also usually has 
 a changelog to indicate what version the current project is, what changes have been made to it in chronological order,
 the changelog is crucial for incorporating code into other software as it usually indicates compatibility. We did not 
 use a specific tool for it, however the documentation was done it a .md file to make the text more approachable.

**Dependencies** 

When working on a project most if not all programmers include libraries or code other people have already written to 
save time. This means that your code now is dependant on other peoples code as well. PyCharm already has a lot of 
other libraries ready to install on demand. I've worked with a few other languages before python so I've already had a 
good understanding of how dependencies work however I did learn to implementing new libraries into my
own code a lot faster than before.
 
**Personal development**

During this first semester I learned a lot about programming both theoretically and practically, In my eyes most if 
not all practicals taught me something useful.

*Practical 1*

Going into this year I had little to no Python experience so during the first practical I think I got a good 
understanding of how to use PyCharm and what Python, as a language is capable of. Most importantly I got the hang
of Pythons syntax.

*Practical 2*

The second practical I really got the hang of basic Python code, started experimenting with it, figuring out the most
Pythonic way to solve a problem. I also got a better understanding of how libraries work, how to incorporate them into 
my code and how to read the documentation that comes with them.

*Practical 3*

 This was the first time I had a chance to work on a programming project with a team. I learned to communicate very 
 clearly of what my future plans are (in terms of what I plan to do with my code), learned to read other peoples code 
 and incorporate my code into theirs. I think this practical was the most beneficial for me personally.
 
 *Practical 4*
 
 Practical 4 was perfect for learning not only to read but also understand the code of other people. I think after 
 this practical I have a good understanding of how to go about finding mistakes in both my code and also the code of 
 my peers.
 
 *Practical 5* 
 
 With this practical I had the most fun. I completely rewrote my code 4 times to get my end result as I tried to make 
 it run as efficiently as I could. This process of making my code work more effectively I think gave me a pretty good
 understanding of the core concepts of Python.
 
 All in all I think I can safely say that after this first half year I have a very good understanding of what goes
 into software development.
